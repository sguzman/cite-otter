CiteOtter’s mascot is a cheerful, book-loving otter popping up through a splash of water, proudly holding a stack of references and a citation slip - a little “librarian swimmer” that symbolizes turning messy sources into clean, structured metadata. The branding uses **Deep Blue (“Cite Blue”)** and **Bright Orange (“Otter Orange”)** as the two primary accent colors.
